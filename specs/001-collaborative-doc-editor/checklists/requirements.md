# Specification Quality Checklist: 多人协作文档编辑器

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASS

- Specification focuses on WHAT users need (editing, collaboration, formatting) without mentioning implementation technologies
- All sections written from user/business perspective
- Clear user value articulated in each user story priority explanation
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASS

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-008 specifies "1秒内同步")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (SC-001: <2秒, SC-003: 1秒内, SC-006: 90%)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (use terms like "用户打开编辑器" not "React component mounts")
- All 4 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases section covers 8 scenarios including network failures, conflicts, performance
- Scope clearly bounded by 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P4)
- Assumptions section lists 7 explicit assumptions about authentication, storage, networking

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASS

- Each functional requirement (FR-001 to FR-018) maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios cover: basic editing (P1), collaboration (P2), advanced formatting (P3), tables (P4)
- Success criteria SC-001 to SC-010 are measurable and achievable
- Specification avoids leaking implementation details - uses terms like "系统" not specific tech

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.

**Key Strengths**:
- Well-prioritized user stories enabling incremental delivery (MVP = P1, collaboration = P2)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage (network, conflicts, performance, compatibility)
- Detailed acceptance scenarios with clear Given/When/Then format
- Measurable success criteria with specific thresholds
- Explicit assumptions documented to guide implementation decisions
