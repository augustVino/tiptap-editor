# Specification Quality Checklist: 编辑器功能增强与主题切换

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the next phase.

### Quality Review Details

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses on user needs and business value without diving into technical implementation. All sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully completed.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 28 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "主题切换响应时间不超过300毫秒") and technology-agnostic (no mention of React, CSS-in-JS, or specific libraries). No clarification markers remain.

3. **Feature Readiness**: The specification includes:
   - 3 prioritized user stories (P1, P1, P2) with clear acceptance scenarios
   - 7 edge cases covering error conditions and boundary scenarios
   - 28 functional requirements organized by category
   - 10 measurable success criteria
   - Clear assumptions and dependencies
   - Well-defined out-of-scope items

4. **Technology Agnosticism**: While dependencies mention TipTap (the existing editor framework), the requirements focus on user capabilities rather than implementation details. For example:
   - ✅ "系统必须支持至少30步的撤销/重做历史记录" (user capability)
   - ❌ NOT: "使用 TipTap History 扩展配置 depth: 30" (implementation)

## Notes

- Specification successfully avoids implementation details while maintaining clarity
- All 28 functional requirements are independently testable
- Success criteria provide both quantitative metrics (response time, completion rate) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction)
- Edge cases cover common error scenarios and boundary conditions
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
